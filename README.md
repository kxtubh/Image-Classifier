# Image Classifier
## A scaled down version of an image classifier that uses Convolutional Neural Networks to classify any images any number of classes. 

This project is to serve as an introduction to CNNS and thier capabilities. The main classifer is a binary classifer which can classify two classes at a time. To classify more than two classes you will need to just uncomment a few lines in the jupyter notebook. As for the dataset, I have downloaded images using an extension called "Download All Images" (https://download-all-images.mobilefirst.me).

## Instructions 
1. Search for any images in your browser and click on the
2. It will automatically download all images in a zip file and save it on your system. In this case I downloaded pictures of cats and dogs and uploaded them onto the colab workspace.
3. This will work for any images.
4. Once all the images have been uploaded into the right directories then run all cells.
