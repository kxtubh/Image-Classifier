To dowload images i have used the Chrome Extension called "Download all images"
Link --> https://download-all-images.mobilefirst.me

Simply search for any images you want and click on the extension icon.
It will automatically download all images in a zip file and save it on your system.
In this case I downloaded pictures of cats and dogs and uploaded them onto the colab workspace.
This will work for any images.
